# WMS [WORK IN PROGRESS]

#### Check [This Issue](https://github.com/WillsMediaServer/WMS-Core/issues/8) to find out about the rewrite before wms leaves the prototyping stage.

Wills Media Server
==================
An all in one Media server with no pay for restrictions or paywalls

Requirements (Newer or Older versions may work but have not been tested)
============
- [ ] Python 3.5.x or higher
- [ ] The following Python modules:
    - flask v0.12.2
    - flask_sqlalchemy v2.3.2
    - requests v2.18.4
- [ ] ffmpeg

###### If you are unable to use pip to install python modules, you can download the libs archive from my google drive [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DSHNxtvYx_kye5pGO_l88lrjJRICiUOc/view) and extract them into the libs folder in Wills Media server. The archive includes all of the modules needed and their dependencies.

Starting WMS
============
To Start WMS all you need to do is navigate to the directory (after downloading and extracting the archive) and then run `main.py`

###### All of the main code is stored in /wms
