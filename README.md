# WMS [WORK IN PROGRESS]

Wills Media Server
==================
An all in one Media server with no pay for restrictions or paywalls

Requirements
============
- [ ] Python 3.5.x or higher
- [ ] The following Python modules (Newer or Older versions may work but have not been tested):

    - mutegen v1.40.0
    - requests v2.18.4

###### If you are unable to use pip to install python modules, you can download the libs archive from my google drive [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DSHNxtvYx_kye5pGO_l88lrjJRICiUOc/view) and extract them into the libs folder in Wills Media server. The archive includes all of the modules needed and their dependencies.

Starting WMS
============
To Start WMS all you need to do is navigate to the directory (after downloading and extracting the archive) and then run `main.py`
