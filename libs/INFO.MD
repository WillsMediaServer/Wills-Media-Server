If you are unable to use pip to install python modules, you can download the libs archive from my google drive [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DSHNxtvYx_kye5pGO_l88lrjJRICiUOc/view) and extract them into the libs folder in Wills Media server. The archive includes all of the modules needed and their dependencies.
